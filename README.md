Project Highlights:

🏗️ Architecture: MVVM
Embraced the power of Model-View-ViewModel architecture for a modular and scalable codebase. This approach not only promotes code clarity but also sets the foundation for future enhancements.

📚 No Third-Party Libraries

Prioritized self-sufficiency by steering clear of third-party libraries. This decision not only deepened my understanding of the project components but also ensures long-term compatibility and maintainability.

💻 100% Programmatic UI

Crafted the entire user interface programmatically, bypassing Interface Builder. This hands-on approach provides unparalleled control over the UI, fostering flexibility and customization.

🔄 SwiftUI Integration into UIKit

Successfully integrated SwiftUI views into a UIKit application, showcasing versatility across different iOS frameworks. This integration opens up exciting possibilities for seamless user experiences.

🌐 Custom Network Layer

Implemented a bespoke network layer for handling requests, tailoring it to the project's unique requirements. This customization allows for advanced features like authentication and precise error handling.

🕸️ Custom URL Cache

Developed a custom URL cache, optimizing data retrieval and storage. Features include cache expiration, robust eviction policies, and enhanced performance beyond default caching mechanisms.

🖼️ Custom Image Cache

In addition to the URL cache, a personalized image cache was implemented. This not only optimizes image retrieval but also allows for tailored strategies like compression and decompression.
🎓 This project was more than just a coding exercise. It was a dynamic learning experience where theoretical knowledge met hands-on application. The tutorial series served as an invaluable guide, transforming concepts into tangible solutions.
